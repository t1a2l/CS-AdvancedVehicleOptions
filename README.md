# CS-AdvancedVehicleOptions 1.9.13.1
* Fixed/adding ability to take over the Race Cars and Bicycles properties properly - thanks again to t1a2l.
* Change of asset properties - Race Cars and Race Bicycles have bogus properties, AVO intially corrects them now. Values can be any time overriden. If 125 km/h is entered for Race Cars, the value will be corrected again. No such effect on the Bicycles.
* Fixed the Russion Language File not showing due to wrong "en" entry in the language file
* Small wording change in Chinese Language file contributed by Eve.

Please note:
Racedays DLC: the race vehicles do good around 100 km/h, but above they will act weird. The standard value is 125 km/h. Due to this, AVO will set them automatically to the data, which are usually used in the race. This is a speed of 75 km/h. You can override this value, but the high you go, the more crazy the vehicles will drive. If you use 125 km/h, AVO will set the speed back to 75 km/h. The Race Bicycles are now doing 50 km/h instead like the City Bikes around 31 km/h. You can change to any speed, the faster the worse they act. Any change will be only applied, if a new event is started. You cannot change speed during an ongoing race event. This is due to game design.
 
# CS-AdvancedVehicleOptions 1.9.13
Tested & Updated for Raceday DLC - special thanks to t1a2l for enabling the Raceday functionality
* Fix added for missing DLCs: If you do not own a specific DLC, the category will now longer show in AVO, so no more empty lists and lockups.
* Added categories to support the Raceday DLC. For convenience reasons, the Race Bicycles have a separate category next to the Racecars and Parade vehicles.
* Added Harmony support as some code lines were requiring functionality of the Harmony lib. AVO flags this now as requirement. (however, I assume most users have already some mod which uses Harmony, so potentially no impact)
* Added the native support for the freight barge, freight helicopter and prison helicopter mod by T1a2l.
* Integrated the XML Bulk Editor created by Testicle some weeks ago. Cick to the mod option panel and check the corresponding section to start the XML editor from the mod. The required HTML file is included in the mod distribution via workshop.
* Updated all language translation files as best as I could using ChatGPT. All supplied language files are now completely translated. If you see something which reads weird or is wrong, please update in Crowdln or report with correct wording in the language comment section.

# CS-AdvancedVehicleOptions 1.9.12
Tested & Updated for Hotel&Resorts DLC
* Fixed - Fix for freezing the game at startup (no longer modal windows, when having a window prompt - especially upon start, when the mod informed user, that a specific service does not have a vehicle assigned)
* Fixed - Hotkey was not remembered, now it is
* Change - Importing the configuration will ask now for confirmation

# CS-AdvancedVehicleOptions 1.9.11
Tested & Updated for Hubs&Transports DLC
* Fixed - Minor code fix, e.g. trailer information for public transport is now shown correct, all special capacities have now an indicator*
* Change - Added a notification for vehicles, when it will be required to set the service building vehicle selector to "Random" with linking to the Wiki instructions
* New Italian translation is now available

# CS-AdvancedVehicleOptions 1.9.10
Tested & updated for Financial Districts DLC
* New - New Section for Bank Service / Cash Delivery Van vehicles

# CS-AdvancedVehicleOptions 1.9.9
Service Release only, no new features, tested & updated for Roads & Vehicles DLC
* Bug Fix for Modal Windows supplied by MacSergey

# CS-AdvancedVehicleOptions 1.9.8
* New - Stand Size selection for passenger planes. All passenger planes can now be re-configured to use Small/Medium/Large stands. Be patient, it will take several minutes until the change is applied, as the setting will be active only for new spawned planes. Existing planes in transit will use the already calculated travel path and will ignore the change. At one point in time re-configured planes will dock to the selected stands. Non Airport-DLC users will not see this option. The selection can be reverted anytime to Default value, settings will be stored in the vehicle config.xml and savegame. Note: Service Vehicle Selector (SVS2) will not show the Passenger Planes in the new selected Stand Type sizes.
* New - Engine/Trailer synchronization for trains. Trains and theirs trailers can now be synchronized when data options are changed on the engine. Data values supported: Speed, Acceleration, Braking, Turning, Springs, Dampers, Lean and Nod. Choose in Mod Options, if AVO shall remember the setting or if it is one-time change only. Engine/trailer sync is done, as long the checkbox in the mainwindow is ticked.
* Change - New logic to sort trucks/busses/service vehicles and their trailers. C:S has not supported bus trailers upto Airport-DLC. Asset Creators used truck trailer templates, with result that AVO sorts e.g. a bus vehicle to the "Bus" section and the bus trailer to "Industrial Farming" - as the bus trailer template was a "farming trailer". To overcome AVO had a comprehenive list in the past checking SteamIDs. This list is removed and AVO now sorts the trailer depending on the engine classification (eg. Public transport Bus or Fire Service). This will make all vehicle trailers sort 100% correct along with the engine vehicle. Works for all road vehicles.

# CS-AdvancedVehicleOptions 1.9.7
* Fixed - More Vehicle compatibility issue which leads to a simulation freeze by infinite loop
* New - Support for Airports DLCs new Aircraft types
* New - Aircrafts will show the required parking stand type
* New - Hotkey for GUI (ALT+SHIFT+O)
* New - Autosave for Vehicle data to XML (save to XML on each change in any data field), added button in Mod Options
* New - Added button in the Mod Options for easy access to AVO config files (vehicles, settings)
* New - Multilanguage support with algernon's Translation Framework with support for Crowdin (EN and DE language available) 
* Change - New configuration settings file (XML format, new storage path)

# CS-AdvancedVehicleOptions 1.9.4

Passenger Helicopter Fix:
The Passenger Helicopter accepts again changes to the passenger capacity (was "read only" before)

# CS-AdvancedVehicleOptions 1.9.3

Vehicle Configuration:
* New - Button for Reset full configuration / all customized settings.
* Enhanced - Export now reports back, where the configuration file is located.
* Fixed - Savegames created with older versions of AVO will no longer fail with error message when loading the vehicle configuration

Vehicle Settings
* Changed - Section for Configuration now called "Actions for Vehicle Configuration".
* Changed - Section "Remove Vehicles" now called "Actions For + Vehicle Type".
* Changed - "Restore Default" is now "Default Values" for a vehicle type. Moved down to Remove Driving & Parked section.
* Changed - Capacity description label will be adapted to what kind of vehicle it is, eg. Public transport will show Passenger while Industry shows Cargo and Postal Service reflects Mail.
* New - Option for display speed units Miles per Hour or Kilometer per Hour.
* Fixed - Full support for Fishing Industry.
* Enhanced - Support for enhanced vehicle properties (eg. pumping rate, travel distance, criminal rate, fishing rate and more).
* Changed - AVO will no longer allow to disable "Bus trailers" from the trailer itself. Reason for that is that the bus trailer is a re-assigned industrial vehicle. However, disabling the main vehicle will disable also the trailer.

Vehicle Locator & Remover
* Enhanced - When pressing SHIFT on the location tag, AVO will directly zoom to the next available vehicle. If SHIFT is not pressed, it will only center to the next available vehicle.
* New - Remove the previously located vehicle.

Mod Compatibility
* Change - AVO will no longer block setting changes, if Improved Public Transport or Transport Lines Manager are present. Instead it will color shared fields in red to warn the user, that this may result in compatibility issues.
* Change - Settings for warnings (triggered by Improved Public Transport and Transport Lines Manager) activate/deactivate the red color coding in shared data fields.
* Removed - Checkbox Options for Improved Public Transport and Transport Lines Manager have been removed.

Vehicle Spawning
* New - Button for accessing directly the Cities Skylines Transport Line Overview panel instead informing the user that "Spawning is controlled by Cities Skylines, IPT or TLM". User can now directly open the Line Overview and change the desired vehicle.
* New - Small help button sending the user to a new section for Spawning Explanation.

Mod Option Panel
* Changed - Compatibility settings in the Mod Option Panel will be only displayed, if the related mod is installed and active (Vehicle Color Extender, IsBigVehicle).

Experimental Mod Support
* New - Mod support NoBigTruck created by MacSergey using the "IsLargeVehicle" flag. You need the mod NoBigTruck installed to make this work. If a vehicle is flagged as "Large Vehicle" the IsBigTruck mod should not send this vehicle to small buildings. Please contact MacSergey for any issues, AVO only sets the flag. Subscribe to the NoBigTruck mod [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2069057130).

Trailer Reference List

- Compatibility towards More Vehicles, no more cargo train issues

# CS-AdvancedVehicleOptions

This version is 1.8.7, incorporating airatin's updates and additional changes intended to make this mod compatible with More Vechicles by @dymanoid, most importantly using ```Array16<T>::m_buffer.Length``` instead of ```Array16<T>::m_size``` to iterate over the filled length of ```VehicleManager.instance.m_vehicles``` and ```VehicleManager.instance.m_parkedVehicles``` to circumvent the use of preset vehicle limits.

# Testing

I've seen a normal frequency of functional cargo trains in multiple cities of different sizes while using this version locally with More Vehicles and many other mods (to be updated), but please test further before incorporating into the workshop version.
